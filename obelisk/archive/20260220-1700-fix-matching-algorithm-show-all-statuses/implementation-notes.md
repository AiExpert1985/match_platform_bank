# Implementation Notes: Fix Matching Algorithm and Show All Statuses

## Execution Summary
All five plan steps executed as specified. Two files modified for logic; two obelisk summary files updated with contract/design entries.

## Divergences
- Plan specified: `Write` for `reconciliation_service.dart` (full rewrite). Actual: used `Write` — consistent with full replacement of algorithm.
- All other edits made via targeted `Edit` calls — no divergence from plan intent.

(Otherwise: Plan implemented as specified. No material divergences.)
